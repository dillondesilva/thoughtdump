It's a busy world but I still want to write and share my experiences on the daily. I felt something along the lines of a microblog would be accomodating of this whilst staying decentralised from platforms like 'X' and Threads. 

Whipped this up in a few minutes using the Paper theme with Hugo and I'm pretty happy with the layout. Looking forward to writing stuff on here!
